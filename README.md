# Test task:

## Conditions:
- Develop an own version of map, which represents a map with keys of type Long.
- Let it be a hash table like, for example, HashMap. You shouldn't use any existing implementations of maps, \
and your implementation should perform as the best as you can make it (using less memory, for example).
- You must provide tests to make a ground for your solution for further interview questions.
